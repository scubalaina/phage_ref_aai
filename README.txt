This repository is a series of bash scripts and python scripts to calculate the ANI of a sequence against a reference database.
Best suited for short sequences (e.g. phage genomes) because of the memory and computing load is relatively low.

The wiki for these scripts is here: https://github.com/scubalaina/phage_ref_aai/wiki .
